# Hosted-voice-app
A  voice app using Twilio TwiML APIs.
You need to have a Twilio account and purchase a phone number.
Sub your hosting service URL, email address, Twilio and personal phone numbers, and LinkedIn & Twitter accounts.

If you want to implement the texting feature (SMS), then do not purchase a Twilio toll free phone number.
Twilio toll free numbers do not support SMS.

The best usage comes from accessing the app with a mobile phone.
Land line phones obviously do not support the texting function, if you decide to implement that feature.

Enjoy.
